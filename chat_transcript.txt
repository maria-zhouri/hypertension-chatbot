User: My blood pressure was 145/95 this morningâ€”should I be worried?
Chatbot: Based on Canadian guidelines, a reading of 145/95 mmHg is considered elevated and may indicate hypertension. While one reading is not always dangerous, it's important to monitor it and speak to a healthcare provider if it remains high. Please remember, I am not a doctor.

User: What kind of foods should I avoid to help lower my blood pressure?
Chatbot: You should limit salty and processed foods such as:
- Deli meats (ham, salami)
- Canned soups and frozen dinners
- Chips, pretzels, fast food
- Sauces like soy or BBQ sauce
Instead, consider the DASH diet which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-sodium foods.
