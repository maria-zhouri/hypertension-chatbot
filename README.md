# Hypertension Support Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot designed to help users better understand and manage high blood pressure through localized, evidence-based guidance.

## Project Overview

This project was developed for the Health Data Analytics course in the Master of Business Analytics program at Saint Maryâ€™s University (Sobey School of Business). It uses Ollama and AnythingLLM to run locally on a user's machine, with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setup that delivers grounded responses using uploaded documents.

## Features

- Provides support in interpreting blood pressure readings
- Offers guidance on diet (e.g., sodium limits, DASH diet) and lifestyle habits (e.g., alcohol, stress, exercise)
- Responds to user queries using plain-language responses grounded in healthcare knowledge
- Operates locally with user privacy in mind

## Knowledge Sources

| File Name                 | Description                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `knowledge_document_1.txt` | BP classification and treatment thresholds        |
| `knowledge_document_2.txt` | DASH diet, sodium limits, foods to avoid          |
| `knowledge_document_3.txt` | Lifestyle advice: exercise, alcohol, stress       |
| `chat_transcript.txt`      | Sample Q&A demonstrating chatbot behavior         |
| `system_prompt.txt`        | Defines tone, scope, and guardrails               |
| `use_case_description.md`  | Describes user pain points and chatbot objectives |

## Demo

A demonstration video of the chatbot in action is included in `demo_video.mp4`.

## Technologies Used

- Ollama for running local large language models
- AnythingLLM as the interface for managing documents and chat context
- TXT files used to simulate document-based retrieval (RAG-style responses)

## Purpose

This project was a practical opportunity to experiment with open-source LLM tools in a real-world healthcare context. It explores how AI can support chronic condition management through simple, user-friendly conversations while respecting privacy and information quality.
